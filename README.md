# Walmart USA ‚Äì Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program

This repository showcases my work completed as part of the **Walmart USA Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/), August 2025.  
The program simulated real-world software engineering challenges faced by Walmart‚Äôs engineering teams, covering **data structures, database design, and system modeling**.

## üìÇ Project Overview

### **1. Heap Data Structure Implementation**
- Developed an optimized **heap** in Java for Walmart‚Äôs shipping department.
- Improved performance for priority-based shipment processing and load optimization.
- Demonstrated **algorithmic efficiency**, **problem-solving**, and **OOP design principles**.

### **2. UML Class Diagram**
- Designed a UML class diagram for a **data processor system**.
- Incorporated **multiple operating modes** and **database connection handling**.
- Ensured maintainable and scalable architecture aligned with system requirements.

### **3. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
- Created an ERD for Walmart‚Äôs **pet department database**.
- Modeled **products, manufacturers, customers, transactions, and shipments**.
- Ensured **normalization** and support for complex queries.

### **4. Database Integration & Data Population**
- Wrote a **Python script** to populate an SQLite database from shipping data spreadsheets.
- Implemented robust logic to avoid duplicate records and maintain **data integrity**.
